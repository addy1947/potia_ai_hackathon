## üß† How It Works: Powered by Portia AI SDK

The Dependency Security Agent leverages the **Portia AI SDK** to provide a robust, extensible, and intelligent automation framework for dependency management and security. Here‚Äôs how it works in Portia terms:

- **Tools Abstraction**: Each core function (dependency scanning, updating, reporting, notifications, etc.) is implemented as a Portia "Tool". Tools are Python classes with a defined name, description, input schema, and output schema, making them discoverable and callable by the agent. This modular approach allows easy extension and integration with new services or data sources.

- **Plans and Plan Runs**: When a user initiates an action (e.g., scan a repo), the agent uses Portia‚Äôs planning engine to generate a structured "Plan". This plan sequences the necessary tool calls and tracks their execution in a "PlanRun" object, providing full visibility and traceability of the agent‚Äôs reasoning and actions.

- **Clarifications**: If a tool requires additional information (e.g., missing credentials, ambiguous input), Portia‚Äôs "Clarification" mechanism interrupts the plan run and requests structured input from the user or another system. This ensures secure, just-in-time authentication and robust error handling.

- **Secure, Authenticated Tool Calls**: Portia‚Äôs tool abstraction supports just-in-time authentication, so sensitive operations (like updating dependencies or posting to Slack) are performed securely, with token refresh and minimal permissions.

- **Extensibility**: New tools can be added by subclassing Portia‚Äôs Tool base class, defining their schemas and logic. The agent can then automatically discover and use these tools in future plans.

- **Cloud and Local Execution**: The agent can run plans locally or leverage Portia Cloud for remote execution, persistent plan run storage, and advanced features like historical tracking and multi-agent orchestration.

**In summary:** The agent‚Äôs intelligence, security, and extensibility are powered by Portia‚Äôs SDK abstractions‚Äîtools, plans, plan runs, and clarifications‚Äîenabling safe, transparent, and customizable automation for dependency management across your organization.
